<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Tuyen. I'm a first year student at Tampere
  University in Finland. I major in Software Engineering and minor in Artificial
  Intelligence and Human-Interaction Technology.
</p>

<p>I'm from Vietnam. It's a very beautiful country with a lots of
  breathtaking sceneries! If Vietnam is on your travel list, be sure
  to visit the beaches in Cam Ranh and try out the seafood there!
</p>

<p>I really want to become a good software developer. That's why I try
 to improve myself everyday. My near future goal is to land an internship, and
 after that, hopefully a software developer job in Finland.
